# Jesse_Livermore_Stock_Market_Key_Plot
Improved(?) plots for stock trading following Jesse Livermore's Market Key using pandas and matplotlib

This project is inspired by https://github.com/lisist/Jessee_livermore_market_key_example with the following additions/changes:

- Uses pandas functionality more extensively and does away with looping over various lists
- Uses data in Yahoo Finance format
- Added plotting of trade dates along x-axis instead of row numbers
- Changed line styles
- Changed background colors
- Saves the generated plots

Other than that it closely follows the original

Requires Python 3.8 or greater,pandas, numpy and matplotlib. Other than that no external dependencies.
